It socializes students into acquiring an understanding of the system of nation-states as a globalized, interconnected space, and often acts as a stepping stone for youth looking for a career in international relations or diplomacy.They are different from military academies that prepare selected candidates to be commissioned into the armed forces.

This situation gives rise to a range of anti-social behaviors: e.g., egocentrism, norm violation, delegitimization, and mistrust of authority.\n\nFor example, when workers have no input in the production process and can hardly see the impact of their work, they might feel their work is meaningless and that they have no real purpose as professionals.",

The world was thought to be mysterious, magical, and miracle-ridden, with submission to the ‘divine will’ being the only path available to man to navigate its unpredictable, unknowable nature.\n\nThis conception of the universe as an enchanted place reflected in all spheres of human endeavor up to the middle-ages.\n\nIdeas of politics and governance, for instance, were centered around the divine rights of kings to hereditary rule.\n\nThe enlightenment turned these ideas on their head, asserting that the world was governed by scientific principles, and that human action was capable of making a positive difference to it.\n\nBecause of their oppositional stance to the prevailing dogma, Enlightenment thinkers suffered constant persecution from the authorities. The French philosopher Voltaire, for instance, spent several years in exile and in prison for his outspoken views on religion and freedom of speech.",

They set up communes based on Eastern religions, particularly Hinduism, and Christian Unitarianism, in places like Oregon and California.\n\nAmong its famous exponents were the poets Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman, and the writer Henry David Thoreau.\n\nWhere the Enlightenment was fuelled by a discourse of opposition between man and nature (presenting nature as a force to be conquered, harnessed, and exploited for the betterment of man), the transcendentalists advocated a unity between man and nature.\n\nNot surprisingly, the transcendentalists were ridiculed by their contemporaries for their beliefs. Edgar Allen Poe, for instance, famously called transcendentalism “a disease” (Sova 2001).",

Unfortunately, it can be difficult to not let these portrayals have a long-lasting effect on our impressions.\n\nHollywood movies that involve characters from various ethnicities and cultural backgrounds often include very stereotypical portrayals. For example, Italians are often portrayed as temperamental and dangerous; the Irish as heavy drinkers and prone to depression; and Aussies are carefree and always barbecuing shrimp. This list could go on for quite some time.\n\nNo one likes to be stereotyped and some movies certainly don’t help."

However, in more traditional households, using physical discipline is still practiced.\n\nIt is easy to make value judgments on whether spanking is right or wrong. And in fact, in countries like England, it’s illegal.\n\nSometimes, when people say they spank because “that’s how it’s always been done in our family”, then this argument becomes an appeal to tradition."

Developing critical thinking skills is a priority and teachers often encourage their students to ask questions.\n\nIn many Asian cultures however, classroom practices are more regimented. Teachers are more authoritarian and in control of instruction. Students are given fewer opportunities for exploration and questioning what is found in the textbooks is not encouraged.\n\nSurprisingly, a lot of Asian parents will pay higher tuition rates to send their children to schools that implement Western teaching practices. At the same time, Western educators admire the high math and science test scores that Asia students achieve, year after year.\n\nThis may be a case of a cultural bias that manifests itself in a form of cross-cultural admiration."

Your answer to this may have a lot to do with your cultural upbringing.\n\nIn individualistic cultures, people have a tendency to explain the behaviors of others in terms of dispositional factors. People do things because of their personality characteristics and internal motives.\n\nHowever, in collectivist cultures, people have a tendency to do the opposite. There is a greater tendency to emphasize situational forces that compel people to act the way they do.\n\nThese cultural biases in explaining people’s behavior have been found in the use of the fundamental attribution error and in cases involving criminal behavior.\n\nMore specifically, people from individualistic cultures are more likely to exhibit the fundamental attribution error than those from collectivist cultures. Similarly, criminals are seen as more culpable for their actions when judged by people from individualistic cultures rather than collectivist ones."

You assume your accent is neutral (or even doesn’t exist at all) while everyone else has an accent. This is because we’re so used to our accent that we see it as the ‘norm’.\n\nEnglish is spoken as the primary language in at least 18 countries. Each country, however, has a different pronunciation. Sometimes those differences can be so strong that two people speaking the same language can have a very difficult time understanding each other. Just put a Jamaican in the same room as a Scotsman and watch the games begin.\n\nWhen one person assumes that their pronunciation of English is the correct one, and people from other countries have an accent, it is an excellent example of cultural bias. More than likely, the people in those other countries consider their pronunciation to be correct and the visitor from a foreign country is the one that speaks funny."

According to Bourdieu, each of them can be acquired through your lifetime and leveraged to achieve social and economic capital. Culture comprises the art, architecture, music, literature, dress, customs, knowledge, rituals, and other intangible wealth of societies accumulated over centuries.\n\nIn every society, certain elements of culture become imbued with greater prestige than others, on account of factors such as: \n\n    The scarcity of their occurrence,\n    The magnitude of effort required to attain mastery over their practice,\n    the direct or indirect monetary value associated with them, or\n    a combination of some or all of these. \n\nSuch cultural elements are called cultural capital. Examples include the ability to speak a dialect, knowing to avoid cultural taboos, being a great violin player, and delicately navigating cultural etiquettes. Like all forms of capital, cultural capital can be accumulated, has value, and can be exchanged for other things valuable.\n\nCultural capital is also closely linked to economic capital, as in most cases, the possession of economic capital is deemed a prerequisite for the diversion of time and labor from economic activities to the pursuit of cultural achievement.",

Frederick Thrasher, an early contributor to the cultural deviance theory wrote that “an immigrant colony…is itself an isolated social world…the gang boy moves only in his own universe and other regions are clothed in nebulous mystery…he knows little of the outside world.” (Thrasher 1927)"

So Shaw suggested a “bottom-up” approach based on his theory that the cause of the delinquency was cultural norms that were being adopted and transmitted by the gangs in an environment of deprivation, poverty, and isolation.\n\nShaw suggested a three-pronged approach to tackle the problems of crime, theft, and vandalism. This included:\n\n- Advocacy,\n- Organizing the community, and\n- Providing services to the neighborhood through volunteers.\n\nWith these three approaches, Shaw attempted to alter the culture of the gangs and change the perception of gang members about which cultural values were to sought and pursued. The idea was to promote productive values (e.g. getting a job, being a law-abiding citizen), and make others undesirable (e.g. committing acts of vandalism)."

Such killings in the West have been documented mostly among newly arrived immigrants working blue collar jobs.\n\nThe motivation for such crimes is cultural notions of honor, masculinity, and ethnic/tribal pride coupled with a lack of access to education. Additionally, perpetrators of such acts see their own cultural code as being above the law of the land.\n\nFurther, as in Walter Miller’s classic formulation of the cultural deviance theory, notions of toughness in some cultures result in an objectification of women, and in turn, violence against them.\n\nMiller (1958) argued that these supposed cultural traits of the working classes represented the formulation of a unique working-class subculture. This was due primarily to an absence of strong male figures during childhood, and was the cause of high rates of delinquency among lower class youth."

It is through cultural transmission that we transmit our history, our art, our literature, and our science. It is essential to the survival and vitality of civilizations.Therefore, when speaking in a criminology context, remember that cultural transmission generally refers to the cultural transmission of deviance. It explains how neighborhoods pass on culturally deviant behaviors through cultural transmission.One of the most important aspects of cultural learning is that it is often unconscious; we absorb the standard and values of our culture without being aware of it. This is why it can be so difficult to change our behavior, even when we want to.The concept of cultural evolution was first proposed by 19th-century anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan. One of the key aspects of cultural evolution is cultural transmission. There are three main types of cultural transmission.One of the most essential aspects of enculturation is language acquisition, and it’s a critical tool for transmitting culture. It allows individuals to communicate their ideas and beliefs to others.",

(Kohfeldt, Grabe, 2014).This is based on the idea that there is no universal standard of good or evil, so every judgment about right and wrong is a product of society. Hence, any opinion on morality is subject to the cultural perspective of each person. This means that no moral or ethical system can be considered the “best,” or “worst”.

The police felt like they could get away with this behavior because it was a group norm. Other police do it, too, and there was no one to complain to.\n\nIn other words, the police in these nations felt deindividuation. They behaved in immoral ways because they were part of a larger organization that normalized and accepted the behavior."

One prominent theory that explains this phenomenon is the differential association theory.\n\nIn the case of the mafia, for example, individuals become members by growing up within its culture. While organized crime families exist globally, the Italian-American Mafia is widely recognized due to its portrayal in popular culture.\n\nUnlike other criminological theories such as cultural deviance or social disorganization, which fall short in explaining organized crime, the differential association theory offers insight.\n\nThis theory addresses the variation in choices made by individuals influenced by the same cultural and social factors. It posits that individuals more exposed to associations that favor law violation over those that discourage it are more likely to become criminals. This is exemplified by the quote from Sutherland (1950) that a person becomes delinquent due to an excess of definitions favorable to breaking the law.\n\nInterestingly, not all members of crime families join criminal networks despite cultural influence. For instance, during the peak of Mafia activity in the 1960s and 1970s, a significant proportion of the NYPD comprised Italian-Americans, some of whom opted for legal careers. The differential association theory provides an explanation for these divergent choices."

While a culture of corruption may not prevail, constant emphasis on moral and ethical conduct is typical. This duality poses a challenge to understanding delinquency.\n\nEntry barriers to white-collar jobs, involving educational qualifications and social capital, deter first-generation lower-class immigrants or individuals from socially disorganized backgrounds. Most employees uphold high standards, reflecting the dominant organizational culture.\n\nHowever, a small subculture may engage in minor transgressions. Differential association theory explains that if a new employee is negatively influenced by this subculture, they may veer towards illegal actions. The theory suggests that close associations with law violators can lead to adopting their definitions favorable to crime.\n\nThe process of transformation towards public corruption is gradual. Individuals may witness minor transgressions, gradually justifying such actions to themselves and others. Technical skills required for corruption are often learned through intimate interactions with those in privileged positions.\n\nOver time, influenced by frequency, intimacy, and duration of associations, individuals learn to rationalize criminal behavior and master techniques to evade detection."

A key concept related to identity formation and performance is the “front” and “back” stage.They are likely to practice answers to possible interview questions on their own. They might have a mock interview with a close friend.According to Beauvoir:They found that after the professor returned examination papers to students, they reacted differently depending on whom they talked to and what grade they got on the exam.This makes them conceal or moderate some aspects of their personalities, opinions, and feelings when they’re in front of their classes.Imagine you come across your boss when you’re a little tipsy in a pub with your friends.For example, Reynolds and Herman-Kinney (2003, p.150) argue that this approach this approach cannot be used to generate testable hypotheses or to offer comprehensive conclusions about human behavior.These schools of thought are built on the premise that people construct their world based on the meanings they ascribe to things (words, situations, encounters).",

Bronfenbremmer’s ideas on the ecology of human development were contrary to the popular opinion of the times that did not account for wider social and cultural influences on human development. The program today serves over 1 million underprivileged children and their families in the US, focusing on holistic, all-round development. Numerous studies have confirmed the tangible benefits to children of the Head Start program. A 2019 study, for instance, found that children who attended Head Start programs ended with higher incomes as adults compared to those that did not (De Haan & Leuvin, 2019). Another study reported that students that were part of the Head Start program had greater probabilities of completing school, and demonstrated higher college enrolment and college completion rates than those who were not part of the program (Bailey et. al, .2021)."

    "description": "It is a form of capital distinct from natural, cultural, and social capital because it reflects tangible value that can be transferred in a financial transaction.The concept was popularized by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (Jourdain & Naulin, 2011). He was also the one to introduce the distinction between cultural, social, and economic forms of capital (Bourdieu, 1986, pp. 241-58).Money has many functions in a socio-economic context. It can serve as a medium of exchange, a unit of account (a measure of value), a store of value, and a standard of deferred payment (standard of value) (Jevons, 1875). Modern economists often list only three functions of money: (1) medium of exchange, (2) unit of account, and (3) store of value (Krugman & Wells, 2006).It is, therefore, different from personal property because it is immovable. Residential real estate can contain a single-family or a multifamily structure that is available for business or non-business purposes.Property that moves on land, livestock, for example, is not necessarily sold with the land so it is also considered a form of personal property. This is where the word comes from: cattle (Old French: chatel) was originally synonymous with movable property.Owning stock or equity entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of a company’s earnings. Stock can be bought and sold either privately or on stock exchanges. Such financial transactions are generally heavily regulated by the government to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the economy of the country it governs.The price of a specific commodity is typically determined as a function of its whole market. Most commodities are raw materials, resources, or products.",

As such, any behavior that has something to do with care and nurture has come to be seen as feminine.We can see this across a range of cultures – from French women wearing lipstick to Chinese women binding their feet so they look petite. Women have across many cultures are expected to dress in fancy clothes and bathe themselves with perfume to make themselves look good (Cranny-Francis et al., 2017).This treatment of women eventually led to an expected behavior that women must speak softly and never challenge authority. It became a trait of desirable femininity to be gently spoken and not stir the pot.As a result, women unfairly came to be regarded as people who cannot control their emotions. The idea emerged that they are vulnerable and need to be protected by strong, stoic men.Here, we can see that women have consistently been put in positions where they must empathize, care, and nurture. Meanwhile, men are put in tough positions where they must take no prisoners, make decisions that could cause harm to others, and defend their patch against outsiders.As such, being sensitive to comments is deemed feminine behavior. Men are brutes and are expected to have thick skin.This social structure stripped women of power—they could work, but society rarely gave them jobs that could make them earn as much as a man did.Men, on the other hand, were expected to dominate and lead. Because of this behavioral expectation in the past, men today who merely follow instructions but do not dominate are considered feminine.Today, it is still considered feminine to gossip about other people, as it displays the behavior of women in the past, where they had little to do—and this absence of work gave them idle time to gossip.Women who spoke against a man were frowned upon. Similarly, it’s why women were for many centuries banned from universities and other intellectual institutions.

The idea emerged that they are vulnerable and need to be protected by strong, stoic men.\n\nThis narrative harms women because it positions them as incapable of making logical decisions or engaging in difficult or dangerous tasks. It’s been used as a reason why women shouldn’t be placed in positions of power.\n\nThis metanarrative about femininity can also be bad for men. Men have learned not to express emotions or else they appear feminine, meaning they must bottle up their fears and worries and never talk about them."

In the long years of human history, men were expected to go to war and do dangerous tasks, while women would stay home and care for the family.\n\nHere, we can see that women have consistently been put in positions where they must empathize, care, and nurture. Meanwhile, men are put in tough positions where they must take no prisoners, make decisions that could cause harm to others, and defend their patch against outsiders.\n\nThus, we have developed a cultural metanarrative of empathy as a feminine trait. If a man expresses too much empathy, he may be seen as a beta male, for example. Similarly, if a woman is seen as empathetic, she is positioned as a potentially good mother and, therefore, a desirable potential romantic partner."

In other cases, it is illegal regardless of whether or not it leads to violence.\n\nSome countries have very extreme formal norms of speech. For example, Thailand has a law that prohibits people from insulting the king. Breaking this law can result in a prison sentence of up to 15 years."

The family thus mimics the functioning of an organism that adapts itself to change to continue being functional.However, in most parts of the world, elderly care is the responsibility of the family. In this, the family performs a critical function of taking care of the aged and the infirm.To this effect, schools teach skills such as language, numeracy, and vocational and technical skills.A child learns skills such as cooperation, coexistence, and conflict management within the school environment.For instance, the American sociologist Talcott Parsons believed that a school uses the hidden curriculum to instil values such as competition and individualism that are characteristic of American society, and essential to its continued progress.Durkheim based his views on a study of Australian Aboriginal tribes but we can experience this function of religion even today.

The family thus mimics the functioning of an organism that adapts itself to change to continue being functional.\n\nAs an example, Parsons gave the case of the emergence of the nuclear family in response to industrialization that served all the critical familial functions demanded of it.\n\nParsons argued that the pre-industrial extended family could not adapt to the new demands of mobility imposed upon the working populations.

For instance, wages are heavily influenced by social pressures, actions of employers, governments, and trade unions.According to Save the Children US, household chores are much more likely to be performed by girls than boys. Girls account for two-thirds of all children who perform household chores for at least 21 hours per week, this amount of time can negatively impact a child’s schooling.Schools often reflect and replicate the discriminatory gender norms found in society. According to Levtov (2013) discriminatory gender norms and stereotypes is seen in teaching practices, such as responding more directly to boys or asking boys more questions, and through classroom organization, such as gendered assignment of chores – asking girls to clean and boys to chop wood.According to sociological studies, men are more likely to hold leadership positions at their working place. Some of the reasons why men are appointed to leadership positions are that the expected ‘normal’ image of a leader is that of a man (e.g. it’s hard to picture a female president – because there hasn’t been one yet!)Women’s opportunities in politics have long been affected by gender norms, alongside with other sociological factors such as wealth and ethnicity. There are several factors to why women lack opportunities in politics, for instance, less time due to household chores, differences in income and education, and ties with other groups such as trade unions.According to feminist theory, gender is socially constructed rather than determined by biology.",

If the best candidate is a male, for example, then the company should have the freedom to choose the male candidate.An example of a quota might be “to ensure 60% of new hires are women.” This allows a hiring committee to split the hiring pool – so, for example, they can hire 4 men and 6 women in a hiring round when they hire 10 people.This approach aims to give people from underrepresented groups the best chance possible to succeed in interviews, without actually forcing the hand of the interviewers.The CVs were randomly sent to different university departments for assessment. The results showed that resumes were not evaluated just on the merits shown: Jennifer was considered less competent, universities were less willing to hire her as a lab manager and even the salary they would offer her was 13% less than John’s.However, a more detailed look showed that the managerial positions held were at the lower level of the scale. The highest level managerial positions were harder to reach for gay men than otherwise similar heterosexual men.Research has shown that people with disabilities are still concentrated and over-represented in lower-paid service jobs (Nario-Redmond, 2019; Wilson-Kovacsa et al., 2008). However, in higher-paid managerial and professional positions, they are under-represented.Studies from the US show, for example, that race is a stronger factor than gender in determining a person’s chances of being promoted or holding higher managerial positions (Gee & Peck, 2018). This points at the importance of intersectionality when thinking about the glass ceiling (Bloch et al., 2020).Motherhood, or its prospect, seems to be a factor in determining women’s career projections and advancements. Fatherhood, however, does not affect men’s professional lives in the same manner, pointing at gender bias and inequality.",

And yet, many senior officials at Pearl Harbor did not pay attention to the warnings from Washington DC about a potential Japanese attack.First, U.S. government officials during the war considered themselves untouchable despite having suffered multiple failures and financial/human losses. They ignored the dangers and negative feedback, blindly trusting the military advantage of the U.S.You don’t speak up because you like your colleagues and want to avoid putting them in an awkward position by challenging their idea. You also want your team to succeed. Anyway no one seems to consider other possible marketing plans, while the dynamic team leader firmly pushes for this campaign.Not all poor group decisions result from groupthink. Similarly, not all cases of groupthink result in failures or ‘fiascoes’ to use Janis’ wording.

It is true that we learn how to behave and think through cultural immersion, and that’s how coherent cultural worldviews, behaviors, accents, and attitudes are transmitted from generation to generation.Heading into the 1990s, scholars were increasingly concerned with the concept of intersectionality – how gender, race, and class intersect.In the context of philosophical history, habitus, a Latin verb meaning to have, was coined in the sixth century in a translation of Aristotle’s ‘hexis,’ which stands for ‘habit’.",

In the same way, posh language and phrases might give clues to the working-class person about who they are speaking with. The habitus of each differs.\n\nHanks (2005) suggests that a certain symbolic domination can occur in many societies due to language.

    "description": "The term imagined communities was coined by the British political scientist and historian Benedict Anderson. He introduced the term in his well-known 1983 treatise Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism.Capitalists used the printing press to publish texts and other written material beginning with the 16th century (Anderson, 1983) and spreading newspapers around nations. This is when print media emerged as a major cultural force.To take a classic example, the United States as a modern nation state was founded only in the 18th century by European settlers who came from diverse ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.Until the 19th century, much of Europe existed as muti-ethnic empires such as the Austro-Hungarian empire, the German empire, the Russian empire and so on.This is an imagined community that crosses national boundaries.The members of this community might never meet each other but feel a strong sense of solidarity with each other on account of their shared life experiences, and common struggle for recognition and acceptance.Social media, and the internet in general, offer a means for individuals to transcend the boundaries imposed by nation states and seek out other members with shared interests, values, and belief systems, all of which are bricks that go into the formation of a community (Gradinaru, 2016).Anderson on the whole does not see nationalism as necessarily being something false, fake, or undesirable. Shared identities are real and are not necessarily negative.Anderson, in his original formation, intended to use the term imagined communities to denote modern nation-states and the political and social transformations associated with their rise in the 20th century.Primordialists point out that while modernist theories such as those of Anderson explain how modern nation-states came into being, they fail to explain the inevitability of nationalism, or its potency (Bairner, 2009).Chatterjee, a postcolonialist, raised objections particularly to Anderson’s hypothesis that the idea of nations as imagined communities was first born in Europe, and it then provided a “modular form” to the rest of the world.For instance, McDowell points out that when Anderson calls an imagined community a “horizontal comradeship” he is using the language of masculine brotherhood (McDowell, 1999).",

To take a classic example, the United States as a modern nation state was founded only in the 18th century by European settlers who came from diverse ethnic and linguistic backgrounds. Added to this diversity was the presence of indigenous American communities from whom the settlers had claimed the territory by force of arms, and a large African-American population brought over from Africa to work as slaves on plantations. This diverse and motley group of people were often engaged in relations of conflict, animosity, and oppression-subjugation. For them to be bonded into one national community with a sense of shared pride over their past involved a feat of imagination made possible through the means of the printing press, and then, newer forms of mass communication such as radio and television. Nationalist symbols became tools in the project of erasing the violent histories of conflict and difference and creating a uniform American nationalism. Examples include:\n\n- The American flag,\n- The American national anthem (star-spangled banner),\n- The statue of liberty (symbolizing the supposedly quintessential American values of liberty and equality)\n- etc."

Anderson first formulated his concept of imagined communities in reference to the emergence of ethno-linguistic movements among the constituents of such empires. But following the end of the second world war, a second movement for the formation of a new imagined community – the European Union – commenced, moving in the reverse direction. Deploying much the same means as that of nation-states, the European Union sought to appeal to a shared and glorious past of the various nations of Europe. The EU leaders pointed to the pitfalls of narrow nationalism that had brought war and conflict upon the European people to promote a larger patriotism to the continent, not nations."

In nations like New Zealand and Australia, tipping is not a part of the culture.\n\nThe expectation in these countries is that the price written on the bill is inclusive of all expenses, including the expense of paying a living wage to your employees. By expecting patrons to tip, the business is seen as breaking a norm that they should shoulder the responsibility of paying a fair wage for their work, and pass that cost on inside of the official price of the service."

The more muscular you are, the more likely you will succeed in the hunt and the fight to defend the women.A man who does not want to fight is viewed as someone who is emasculated or powerless. Sadly, men who try to de-escalate situations or are pacifists are often seen as ‘less than’ ideal because of their peaceful mindsets (Cranny-Francis et al., 2017).Assertiveness is a behavior of a leader.

Today, it has remained in the deep psyche of human beings that the best men are muscular – even though we live in a more civilized world now where intelligence is just as valued as brute force.

The idea is to spread the message as far and wide as possible within the target market with the goal of getting a small percentage of readers to heed the message.\n\nFlyers are generally designed to give one quick and easy message such as ‘vote for this candidate because they will lower taxes’ or ‘our happy hour is 6pm to 8pm’."

Everyone within a region receives the text message with the child’s name, age, and appearance, in order for the community to keep an eye out for the child. In this sense, an emergency text message alert is an example of a public good.\n\nOne famous example of a text message alert was the Hawaii false missile alert of 2018. Human error caused the government to send a text message out to the entire population of Hawaii warning them that a missile was on its way to Hawaii. The alert even said that this was ‘not a test’. People sought shelter wherever they were and hid and waited. Slowly, news got around that this was a mistake and everyone was safe!"

Podcasts did for radio what streaming services did for television: they enabled people to consume content at their own pace rather than relying upon a concurrent broadcast.\n\nAnother upside of podcasting is that anyone can create and distribute a podcast using a podcast distribution service.

This left the public sphere and decision-making almost exclusively to men for most of human history. One prime example of how gender has been seen as a master status is in the right to vote.

After the war, it was a key component of Japanese militarism, which led to the country’s invasion of China in 1937.\n\nIn the 21st century, expansionist nationalist sentiment has been growing in several countries, including China and Russia. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a quintessential example of expansionist nationalism due to Putin’s belief that Ukraine ‘belongs’ to Russia."

        "description": "Linguistic nationalism is the idea that a nation should be defined by a common language. This is in contrast to other forms of nationalism, which may place more emphasis on a shared culture or ethnicity.\n\nLanguage nationalists often argue that a shared language is necessary for social cohesion and communication and that it is an important part of a nation’s identity.\n\nHowever, critics argue that language nationalism can lead to linguistic discrimination and oppression. They also point out that many nations are already multilingual, and that forced assimilation into a single language would be impractical and potentially harmful.\n\nAn example of linguistic nationalism was the suppression of the Catalan language during the reign of General Franco in Spain. The idea was if Catalonians lost their language, they would more likely assimilate into the federalist Spanish culture.\n\nQuebec, a province of Canada, also has an undercurrent of linguistic nationalism. The province, which calls itself a nation despite lack of federal or international recognition, has enacted a range of policies designed to force people to speak French in educational, business, and political spaces."

The principle here is that religions are illiberal and, therefore, should not be tolerated in a liberal society.\n\nThis is a form of liberalism that is so aggressive that it has contorted itself and become illiberal.\n\nLiberal nationalists also tend to support a limited role for government in the economy, believing that the free market is the best way to promote economic growth and development."

In many cases, liberation nationalists have also sought to promote independent economic and social development within their countries.\n\nIt is similar to left-wing nationalism in its anti-imperialist ambitions.

National socialists also have a strong commitment to racial purity and, in Germany, sought to create a purely Aryan society through policies such as eugenics and anti-Semitism.\n\nWhile it has the term ‘socialism’ in its name, national socialism tends not to embrace socialist policies. It is anti-trade unionism and pro-corporatism. However, it does tend to embrace the nationalization of key industries so that they may support the nation’s military efforts.\n\nToday, there are small pockets of national socialist groups in many Western nations, but they usually only number in the low thousands."

For example, pan-Arabism envisions an Arab state that spans northern Africa and the Arabian peninsula. It has also been envisioned in Bolivarian areas of South America (e.g. Venezuela and Colombia) and across the continent of Africa (pan-Africanism).\n\nPan-nationalism tends to manifest itself as a form of left-wing socialism due to its opposition to colonialism and imperialism.

Even though they are not involved in any criminal activities (beyond underage smoking, drinking, and the occasional face-off with their rivals), the viewer gets a clear sense of their being deviants.\n\nAs long as nonviolent youth gang associations do not result in the youths being confined to correctional institutions, they are a form of primary deviance."

The parents of such children can even be booked under law for having committed a criminal offence.\n\nSimilarly, the United States has ‘truancy officers’ as a part of its education system whose job it is to investigate and deal with chronic absenteeism among school children.\n\nTruancy is a form of primary deviance as children may at first be avoiding school due to compelling reasons ranging such as family troubles to the fear of violence from a bully or a particular teacher at school.\n\nIf labeled and allowed to degenerate into secondary deviance, a truant child may grow up to be an adult who develops a pathological attitude of avoidance towards all forms of responsibility, commitment, and discipline."

Thus a workaholic displays their “deviant” behavior prior to being labeled.\n\nIn fact, given the present popular discourse around maintaining a healthy work-life balance, labeling is likely to push a workaholic to improvement, rather than to an exacerbation of their “deviance”, as happens in the case of secondary deviance.

Self-interests are the central factor in explaining human behaviorBecause almost every decision-making process is a cost-benefit analysis, actions that result in the most utility maximization can be predicted or anticipated.Individuals with similar preferences are likely to form a group. The shared interests or common values influence their behavior as a group and can be used to predict future behavior.The theory assumes that all human decisions are driven by self-interest but this is not always the case.However, this is not always the case. There are some decisions which are made “impulsively” or without consideration of the consequences.It assumes that all decisions begin and end at individual level. Studies have shown that not all decisions are self-serving as individuals may, at times, succumb to social pressure even at the expense of their own benefit.For instance, a wealthy person is more likely to vote for a party that wants to lower taxes on the rich. This person is in turn less likely to vote for socialist parties who tend to favor higher taxes.Those who can afford to choose when and what they eat often have to decide between maintaining a healthy diet or instantly gratify themselves albeit with excessive unhealthy foods.Human beings are naturally social beings which means the need to belong to a group is one that cannot be ignored easily.

(Paul, 2022)\n\nIt is obvious that such a metaverse would be created, maintained, and regulated by highly specialized firms and algorithms.\n\nThe metaverse would also need access to vast amounts of user data in order to personalize the experience for each user, just as web-based applications such as Google and YouTube use our personal data to customize the ads we see on them.\n\nThe metaverse would thus be built and regulated by highly knowledgeable individuals, and it would have access to vast amounts of data about each individual on the basis of which to make rational decisions.\n\nEntrants to the metaverse would need to abide by its regulations, just as people using social networks today need to follow the policies laid down by the specific social network.\n\nThe metaverse would then be a classic manifestation of rational-legal authority, combining knowledge-based reasoning and legal codes to implement its authority."

The financial and time cost of continuing to care for the terminally ill family member may become more than they can bear.\n\nSimilarly, the doctors or medical professionals performing the act of euthanasia undergo role conflict, having sworn to protect life, but being asked to take one instead.

When working with my education studies students, we often talk about the labels we give students, and the possible effects they may have. If a teacher labels a student dumb or inadequate, that student comes to learn that they’re not expected to do well. The student may begin to set low expectations of themselves. They might label themselves as dumb and incapable, and therefore decide not to try very hard. Here, we have led the student down the path of secondary deviance. You can also use this example to separate out primary versus secondary deviance. Primary deviance: If you tell a student who performs badly in a test that they “can do better next time” or that you “expect better results next time”, you’re constructing primary deviance. In other words, you’re not labelling the student as dumb, but labeling them as capable with effort. Secondary deviance: If you label a student who performs badly as ‘dumb’, or even start giving them easier work, you might send them signals that you don’t expect much of them. You’re encouraging them to internalize the idea that they’re not smart.

People with gaps in their resumes may get characterized as deviants in such a hypercompetitive professional environment that rewards constant activity as demonstrated by professional and personal achievements, and penalizes stillness, or the cessation of professional activity. People may have gaps in their resumes for a variety of reasons ranging from the need to provide care to ailing family members, dealing with personal traumas, or quite simply, to stop and make sense of the often overwhelming nature of life. In the absence of any discourse normalizing such gaps, these people have no other yardstick to measure their situation by, except for the dominant corporate template in which professional gaps are equated with failure and laxness. In a system that demands relentless accounting for every year of your life (demonstrated to have been dedicated to the achieving of such professional goals as deemed desirable by the recruiter), hiding such a gap becomes impossible. The professional CV thus can be thought of as an institution in itself in which the stigma of the gap becomes an indelible negative label.

In his study of two Californian cities with similar socio-economic profiles yet widely varying rates of delinquency, Cicourel demonstrated that it was the difference in the perceptions of the law enforcement and justice systems that created the delinquency, not actual crime. The police stereotyping included: Physical appearance (darker skin color, unkempt hair, disheveled clothing), and Manner of speech more closely associated with the wrong social class. In cities where more people possessed those labels, the rates of delinquency were much higher.

Becker in his influential work The Outsider (1963) explains how professional musicians begin to think of themselves as being different from the rest of society. Professional musicians, according to Becker, begin to feel isolated from society as they feel that their audience, for the most part, has no real appreciation for, or understanding of the nuances of music. Himself a Jazz musician, Becker spent several years performing with Jazz ensembles in Chicago as part of his fieldwork. As service professionals whose sense of self is deeply connected to the patronage and appreciation by their audience, musicians are a classic case of symbolic interactionism. That is, a case study in how the self is constructed in interaction with others. As Becker (1951) observed during his several years of performing as a Jazz musician, the average customer at a Jazz bar did not much care for the more complex, intricate, improvised pieces of music that the musicians themselves loved to play. Instead, the vast majority demanded the same simple, sugary, commercialized music that the musicians themselves despised, leading to a feeling of contempt and superciliousness developing among the musicians for their audience. This kind of interaction between the professional musicians and their audience led to the musicians first steadily isolating themselves, and then increasing this isolation through what Becker calls a process of “self-segregation”. This isolation is not a physical one, but rather a mental and social one, in which the musician becomes obsessed with building a defense in their heads against what they perceive as outside control over their craft, by people ( i.e. their audience, for whom they are bound to perform in return for money) who are utterly incapable of appreciating and understanding their craft. Musicians did this, for instance, by using slang such as calling the ordinary person “a square”, by extension implying that a professional musician is not a square, but a deviant. With time, this attitude of perceiving themselves as different from society leads professional musicians into more negative forms of deviant behavior such as drug use, as they feel that the standard norms of social behavior no longer apply to them as deviants."

The Criminal Tribes Acts were a series of legislations passed by the British colonial state in India under which entire communities,villages, or tribes were declared as criminals. Men of such communities were required to report to the local police stations every week, irrespective of whether or not they had committed any criminal act, and were not allowed to leave their designated residential areas without passes. Thus all members of such tribes and communities were labelled criminals by the state simply on account of being born into that tribe or community. This led to severe stigma being attached to such tribes that continues to this day. The colonial state attempted to justify its labelling by pointing to higher crime figures attributed to members of the criminal tribes, in what can be perceived of as simply a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies. In present day India, such tribes are referred to with the only marginally less stigmatizing label of “denotified tribes” or “ex-criminal tribes” – a stark reminder of the lasting effects of institutional labeling. Thus even though the post-colonial state has attempted to reverse the labeling applied by the colonial state, it can only do so by once again drawing attention to, and thus reinforcing the original act of negative labeling. If the colonial state “notified” certain tribes as criminal, and the postcolonial state attempts to reverse this action by “denotifying” them, the permanence of the original act of negative institutional labeling persists."

Edwin Lemert (1912-1996) in his study of primary and secondary deviance presented a case study of Inuit communities on the pacific coast of Canada among whom stuttering was uncommonly prevalent. Lemert (1967) pointed out that in Inuit culture, ceremonial speeches were an important ritual, and thus the ability to speak clearly and eloquently in front of an audience without the slightest slip of the tongue was a marker of social prestige. At the same time, stuttering had an uncommonly high rate of prevalence in the Inuit community. Lemert attributed this apparent contradiction to the prevalence of secondary deviance. Given the great importance attached to clearly enunciated speech in Inuit communities, someone with even the slightest speech disorder is likely to be considered a deviant. Thus children, unable to enunciate clearly under social pressure may be considered deviants and labelled as stutterers and stammeres despite the fact they only stuttered in some situations. Over time, children may internalize this image of themselves as stutterers, resulting in the stuttering becoming chronic, and not just during public speaking."

There is a shift from being a consumer of knowledge to being a producer of goods or services. This shift is ‘learned’ through a process of socialization that involves interacting with mentors, colleagues, parents, and other adults in society. Besides this generic transformation that is needed to transition to being a professional, there is another level of socialization which is specific to each workplace. Every workplace -be it a corporate office, a small business, or even the home – requires a set of norms, behaviors, and rules that need to be adhered to. This is called the work culture of the place. New employees in an office are often put through a process of orientation or onboarding that acquaints them with the work culture of the employer."

While mass media influences children and young adults in a process of primary socialization, its impact on adults is equally significant. As an example, users of social media platforms such as Twitter or LinkedIn create elaborate social profiles on these networks, carefully curating the content they put with the intention of presenting a specific image of their online “selves” to their followers. In this process, they are essentially creating a new self on the social platform in a process of secondary socialization."

Michel Foucault used the term “governmentality” to describe the techniques through which people are governed by the everyday, mundane exercise of state power (Foucault, 1991). In a modern nation-state, an individual can only exist if they exist on government records. Besides bringing the self into existence through identification documents, the state also shapes the individual self through education, instruction, and propaganda. For instance, the singing of national anthems, recitation of oaths of allegiance, frequent re-enaction of key moments in nationalistic histories through plays, songs, and movies can all be forms of nationalistic propaganda. These are all acts through which individuals are socialized into an affiliation for the nation, and by extension, helping create a notion of the self that is intimately tied to the nation-state. It is due to this socialization that most of us, when we asked to define our “selves”, often begin by stating our nationality first. The idea of being American, Canadian, English, or French becomes entrenched into our idea of the self through secondary socialization."

Finishing schools began to diminish in importance in the middle of the 20th century with a shift in the social roles of women. However, beginning with the 21st century, finishing schools have re-emerged with an altered business model in which older, professional women attend such academies to acquire social skills expected of people in their position (Simonian, 2010)."

The act of migration peels back the layers of accumulated socialization, laying bare the socially constructed notion of the “home” and the “self”. It forces an individual to adapt to a new culture, requiring them to become accustomed to new languages, cuisines, social norms, and behaviors. All this occurs through a process of first unlearning the old customs and learning the new through a process of getting socialized into the new society. Thus, migration acts as an agent of secondary socialization."

Examples of bonding to increase social capital include attending a family picnic, or the high school basketball team meeting up over a barbeque. In such instances, you already know all of the people in the group and have some social relationships already established. The goal of these situations is to deepen bonds rather than expand them.

An example of bridging is interactions between students from different countries during an exchange program.

In this situation, the friend acts as a ‘bridge’ between you and the new person with who you will be able to network."

Aldrich argues that connections with people in power and government are essential for grassroots community groups to get things done, as well as for governments to most effectively support the communities that they represent.

So, what changed? According to Aries, the industrial revolution led to improved standards of living. Families no longer needed to send their children to work immediately. They could send their kids to school for longer and protect them from adult life until an older age. As a result, the social construction of childhood also changed.

Today, we might visualize Australians as completely different people. We see it as one of the most successful multicultural nations in the world.

And yet, these strict and even cruel teachers were seen as 'good' teachers because that was the norm back then. Today, we construct the idealized teacher identity in a very different way. The good teacher today is one who is responsive to students’ emotional needs, encourages conversation about topics, and tries to differentiate their teaching for every student’s individual needs."

        "description": "Since the 1980s, the social model of disability has demonstrated how people with disabilities have historically been socially constructed in damaging ways. This model has dramatically changed how society constructs disability in recent decades. For example, a person with an intellectual disability has historically been socially constructed as incapable of basic tasks, quarantined from society, and forced to live a quiet life on the outskirts of society. But since the 1980s, society has increasingly attempted to include children with intellectual disabilities into mainstream classrooms. Society recognizes that they have the right to be equal participants in society, educated among their peers, and encouraged to get jobs in fields in which they are capable. Here, we see two competing social constructs. The first is that of the 'incompetent' disabled person who is forced to live a lonely life. The second is that of the 'agentic' disabled person whose right to be seen as a normal participant in society is respected. It’s the same disability, but socially constructed in completely different ways in the social imaginary."

But, it does mean that the meanings we ascribe to space are socially constructed. Take, for example, a public park. While we can all agree that it has grass, trees, and a playground in it, our cultural relationship with the space is going to change dramatically depending on the context. I have a personal example of this. Once, I was on a video chat with a friend. I was in a park down the street from my house in Vancouver, Canada. He was calling from Detroit. He noticed that the sun had set and night was creeping in. 'You had better get home,' he said, 'before you get hurt.' He and I had constructed the park in very different ways. To me, the park was a peaceful family place. Never would I feel unsafe or afraid. But for him, coming from a more dangerous city, the park was constructed as a dangerous place to be feared and avoided. Same park, completely different social constructs."

When we look at 1950s women’s magazines, women’s happiness was regularly constructed as involving raising children, cooking dinner for the husband, and leaning heavily into traditional gender roles. Today, dominant cultural constructs of women’s happiness have diversified and changed. But we can still see that society has decided to construct it in other ways now. For example, happiness is often linked in television advertisements to having a good career, your own house, and a good car. Here, happiness is tied to economic rationalism. It’s not about having deep relationships with family or a strong sense of spirituality and community. Late capitalism may have replaced its ideas of gender-based happiness with something else, but that other thing is a decidedly capitalist form of happiness."

        "description": "In contrast to the previous two examples cited, colonial anthropologists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries traveling to remote tribal and “primitive” societies, were often struck by the remarkable order and absence of crime from such societies. While they may not always have approved of the means of dispensing justice in such societies – comparing “primitive” law mostly unfavorably with systems of justice in the western world – they did, however, note the sense of community and organization in primitive communities, and their efficient functioning for the purpose of maintaining order. Some examples include Weber’s writings on primitive law, and Malinowski’s Crime and Custom in Savage Society. R.R. Marett summed up the attitudes of a generation of sociologists and anthropologists when he wrote that “ in a savage community, it is often hard to distinguish any sovereign determinate person vested with the power either of making or maintaining the laws. Nevertheless, the result is often so law-abiding in the sense of being responsive to social order, that it might seem superfluous to provide a legal machinery that must actually but rust in disuse.” (Marett 1912) Of course, sociology has since moved well beyond such simplistic binaries of savage and civilized, but these examples serve to buttress the basic premise of the social disorganization theory – that all societies, in their natural, stable state, have mechanisms for the internal regulation of human action and behavior, and delinquency occurs when such community-based mechanisms are disturbed or broken."

Such individuals, isolated from their social groups on account of the breakdown of traditional groupings such as family, church, etc., and being unable to cope up with a rapidly changing environment around them, begin to display deviant behavior. Think of “lone wolf” shooters who often attack immigrants. A famous pop-cultural example would be the character of Travis Bickle played by Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver, who, living an isolated life cut off from his family and community, and struggling to make sense of the rapidly changing post-Vietnam war American society, begins to harbor delusions of “cleaning up” his neighborhood."

        "name": "Strengths of Social Disorganization Theory",
        "description": "1. Grounded in Empiricism – The social disorganization theory was one of the earliest projects that marked the empirical turn in sociology from a theoretical perspective. The Polish Peasant in America, for instance, was based on thousands of personal documents, interviews, and case histories, resulting in a 5-volume magnum opus. Other University of Chicago projects, such as those by Shaw & McKay (1969), and Park & Burgess (1925) too, relied on large bodies of empirical data collected over several years, detailed city maps, and voluminous statistics to produce elaborate theoretical models. 2. Durability – In the second decade of the 21st century, the theory has now been around for a little over a century. Unlike many other premises of the social and natural sciences, the theory, however, continues to stay relevant, even though it has been modified and adapted several times from the time of its first formulation. 3. Accuracy – Within its limited scope, the mathematical models derived from social disorganization theory worked remarkably well in predicting delinquency. For instance, the unit-weighted regression model devised by Ernest Burgess, a founding theorist of the social disorganization theory to predict the parole success rates of convicts is noted as a remarkably accurate model, and one that further found application in fields such as insurance. Burgess based his model on assigning scores to convicts on various parameters of their integration with their social environment, such as having a job, a family network, etc. 4. Provides Actionable Policy Insights – The theory is useful in drawing our attention to what works and what does not when it comes to tackling crime. For instance, by pointing to the roots of delinquency, the theory helps explain why incarceration and the penal justice system are futile in reducing crime. Several studies, for instance, Pratt & Cullen (2005) have in fact demonstrated that incarceration is inversely related to crime. The theory gives several actionable policy insights such as where to direct public funding to prevent crime (certain neighborhoods, as depicted by mapping models), how to govern urban cities (delegating more authority to the neighborhood and community-level organizations), and which social values to uphold (families, as units that can prevent social disorganization)."

At the same time, not everyone identifies equally strongly with the nation of their birth or with the idea of loyalty and patriotism to any nation state at all.

When the change is down it can be descending social mobility or social sinking.Usually, when social mobility is discussed, it is made with reference to the change of a person, or group, either up or down the social ladder.If someone acquires a higher social status than his or her parents it is called upward intergenerational mobility.Like in intergenerational mobility, intragenerational mobility can be upwards or downwards.As a result of exchange mobility, the ratio between different classes in society remains the same. This is because both upper and lower-status jobs gain new members at the same time, which keeps the balance (Markandya, 1982; Schluter & Van de gaer, 2011).",

Conversely, a student’s social roles might be to study, learn, and attend class.In larger communities, they are usually experienced community members and experts in important topics who have strong leadership skills. Leaders are necessary to help ensure there is a clear social hierarchy and chain of decision-making.For example, every leader needs a group of followers who will provide them with social authority. They consent to the leader’s authority, follow their lead, and even do tasks assigned to them by the leader.Parents serve the role of being the first teachers for children. They pass on morals, values, and traditions to the next generation so culture can carry on across generations.In some societies, this role is valued and protected. For example, growing up in Australia, I was given a monthly payment from the government so I could study without having to work.Children have a protected status in society and are expected to interact with society in unique ways.This role is respected and has its own special status as well. For example, often the only person who is allowed to visit a sick person in hospital is a spouse. A spouse may also be allowed to sign for packages or sign legal documents on behalf of their significant other.They may take on special tasks such as babysitting or providing advice to the parents. In some societies, they even live with their children and grandchildren in a multigenerational household so they can be an extra support for thier families.In some churches, your roles may even be subdivided depending on how you support the church. When I grew up, I attended Catholic church, where there were altar boys and volunteers who did the first reading from the bible each week.In many ways, volunteers are necessary for society to function. Especially in times of disaster, a volunteer takes on an extremely important role in helping the needy.Friends are there to enjoy the journey of life together.In western democracies, all communities have representatives who go to parliaments to pass laws on behalf of the community. If you live in a conservative community, your representative is likely to reflect those values and vote accordingly. The same goes for liberal communities.For example, the server knows when to approach the table, uses phrases we are all familiar with like “may I take your order?” and “how is everything?”Interestingly, the role of teacher has changed a lot over time. For instance, in the early 1900s, most teachers were males. Today, most are females.A society without doctors would lead to lower quality of life and lower life expectance. As a result, doctors hold a very special position.As a result, they have special powers not given to anyone ese – like being able to arrest people or part anywhere they want!For example, in Aboriginal Australian society, elders are so highly respected that they are the leaders of communities. They represent their community to the colonial government and traditionally passed judgement when people contravened the laws of the community.Judges determine if people are punished or no, and need to interpret the law. As a result, they need to be able objective and respectful of the law.One example of someone with an extremely important social role is Alexi Navalny. He was a dissident who spoke out against the slide of Russia toward dicatorship.Countercultural figures often even end up being the ‘culture producers’. For example, Hip Hip artists in the late 1980s were out of the mainstream, but their new form of music and clothing became so popular that they influence mainstream fashion and music choices.They write books about the past as well as making documentation about the present.Journalists can be very powerful members of society. In fact, sometimes they’re so good at exposing the truth and holding the powerful to account that they end up getting falsely arrested and imprisoned!For example, the group PFLAG is an ally of the LGBT community. Its job is to advocate for and support their friends who have historically been discriminated against.Without allies, social justice is very difficult. So, allies can be the important people magnifying the voices of those in need and advocating on their behalf.If you ask your child who Mr Beast or Mark Rober are, they’d certainly know (by the way, they’re famous YouTubers).Back in the middle ages, court jesters were able to make jokes about the king without being hung. They had a very special role of speaking truth to power.I have.Some employers become very important members of our communities. They donate to local sports groups, employ high school kids in their first jobs, and ensure we get the products and services we want!For example, the civil rights protesters were instrumental in changing the United States for the better. Nevertheless, instrumental figures like Martin Luthur King Jr. were shunned and seen as deviant figures.",

Just like organs they, “performed a specifiable function for the organism as a whole.” (Wright, 2015, p.713).People cohere around racial identities both as a matter of self-identification and through ascribed statuses that they have no choice about. This can result in different treatment of groups based upon their identification. Sociologists often concern themselves with identifying how societies are stratified on racial lines.Abramson (1976) suggests a four-point definition of ethnicity:However, community can mean different things to different people. Some sociologists believe that a main component of a community is a specific geographic location where people live together. While, others, like American anthropologist Robert Redfield (1989) emphasize the homogeneity of thought among a community’s members.Sociologists look for explanations for why voters prefer the party that they vote. These explanations are often found in socio-structural variables such as social class, religion, urban-rural residence and region.Primary groups involve direct, personal, and intimate interactions.

Socialization is how social and cultural continuity is attained (Clausen, 1968 & Macionis, 2013, p. 126).It is mainly influenced by the people the child spends the most time with. This process starts with family and friends. The child learns what is or is not acceptable in that society. Primary socialization teaches children how to bond, communicate, create relationships, understand others, and so on (Whitbeck, 1999).Individuals do this to ease their entry into the group. This process involves changes in one’s behavior, attitudes, beliefs, values, and so on in preparation for a shift in one’s role. Anticipatory socialization can be further divided into two categories: vocational and organizational anticipatory socialization.It is the mechanism through which new employees and interns learn the necessary skills and behaviors to become members of an organization (Bauer & Erdogan, 2011, pp. 51-64).Gender socialization is the process by which boys learn to demonstrate masculinity and girls learn to demonstrate femininity (Naples, 2020, p. 216).

        "description": "When sourcing a product that is ethical, you are demonstrating a sociological imagination because you’re balancing individual need with social good. The use of ethically sourced products has seen a rise in the last few decades, especially in First World countries. An ethically sourced product is one which assures the end user that it was sourced and produced using ethical, humane, and non-exploitative means. Often this also means that producers and laborers involved in its production were paid fair wages, were provided safe and healthy workplaces, that no child labor was used, that local communities benefitted from its production, etc. More consumers today insist that the products they buy be ethically sourced. In making this decision, the consumers are demonstrating a sociological imagination in which they are conscious of not just their own needs and benefits, but also of those who produce the products they consume. For instance Starbucks prominently displays on its website its ethical sourcing protocol called Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.) under which it sources coffee grown using sustainable and environment-friendly methods, from farmers who are paid just compensation for their produce. Starbucks does this because several of its customers view their everyday cup of coffee with a sociological imagination, and realize that most coffee is grown in poor third world countries where farmers have to grapple with the challenges of poverty, environmental degradation, and climate change. Moreover, coffee cultivation outside of its place of origin – Ethiopia and the Arabian peninsula – is directly the product of European colonialism. Dutch traders took the coffee bean from Ethiopia and planted it first in India and later in Indonesia. From there, its cultivation spread to South America. At each place, large plantations owned by exploitative colonial masters and worked by poorly paid indigenous labour was the standard mode of coffee production until the early 20th century. A consumer of a Starbucks coffee who insists on seeing its ethically sourced label ( or C.A.F.E., as Starbucks calls it), is likely conscious of this entire sequence of events in history, and his or her own place within it."

By avoiding conflict resources, you’re demonstrating a sociological imagination. The most common conflict resources are known as the 3TG – tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold. Tantalum and Tungsten are trace minerals used for making tiny but critical internal components that go inside electronic and electrical equipment such as mobile phones, computers, and light bulbs. As a result, they are not as prominently visible to the end user as fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and edible consumer items. Nonetheless, their use in funding brutal wars has been flagged by socially conscious members of civil society. In 2009, Time magazine used the term “blood computers” to refer to the widespread use of microcomponents sourced from conflict zones in Africa that went into the making of computers and mobile phones (Dias, 2009). The term “blood computers” was a reference to the better known phenomenon of blood diamonds or diamonds sourced from war-torn regions of Africa the proceeds from which went into fuelling bloody armed conflict in the region often involving child soldiers. As a response, the US government introduced the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, one of whose provisions was the mandatory disclosure of the use of conflict resources, if any, that went into the manufacture of products sold in the USA.

The concept of common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR) is used in the context of climate action to combat global warming and climate change. It implies that all nations of the world have a common responsibility to curb emissions and counter climate change. At the same time, it recognizes that certain nations, particularly those of the developed world, must bear a greater burden of this responsibility on account of social and historical reasons which allowed them to achieve a much higher level of industrial development due to the early start they had in the race for industrialization. It follows then that these industrialized countries of the First World are likely to have contributed more to global emissions, and for far longer, than those that are still undergoing industrialization. The CBDR principle also recognizes that the industrialized countries have accumulated a larger share of global wealth, and thus possess greater capability to act against climate change compared to developing countries. The principle of CBDR was first adopted during the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. It recognizes that climate change and global warming are the result of specific historical and social processes that unfolded over the course of the last 3 centuries with the onset of the industrial revolution in Europe, and needs to be viewed within this context."

Their benefit is that they can increase inclusion and diversity, while others argue that they unfairly discriminate against individuals based upon identity markers alone. Examples of affirmative action policies include reservations in jobs or educational institutes for members of underrepresented or historically marginalized communities. For instance, in the USA, several universities reserve seats for members of the African-American, indigenous American, and other marginalized communities. The rationale behind such policy action is that several studies conducted throughout the 20th century showed that university enrolment in the African-American community stood well below the national average. Viewing such a fact from the perspective of a sociological imagination pushes us to uncover the reasons that underlie it. Sociological studies have demonstrated that low levels of university enrolment among African-Americans is due to a host of socio-economic reasons that have their roots in the historical marginalization and stigmatization of the community in the United States that continued well into the first half of the 20th century. Similarly, members of other disadvantaged or underrepresented groupings such as women, differently abled applicants are encouraged by both state-run and private organizations to apply for positions, recognizing the fact of their historical marginalization."

        "name": "The Four-Day Work Week",
        "description": "The four-day work week is a proposed arrangement under which employees would work for four days a week and be off-work for the remaining three. This policy represents an understanding of both the individual need for recreation and the social need for a productive workforce. The arrangement is gaining traction over the last few years and several companies around the world have conducted trial runs that have reported encouraging results in terms of employee productivity and satisfaction. It is speculated that the four-day work week may well become the norm in the future and replace the present professional norm of the five-day work week. The five-day work week itself gained widespread adoption only in the early twentieth century. It was the result of large-scale agitation by labor unions worldwide for better working conditions. These agitations reached a boiling point during the 1917 October Revolution in Russia when workers and miners went on strike en masse protesting against poor working conditions. Taking his cue from the events in Russia, Henry Ford was among the earliest industrialists to introduce a five-day work week. (Counter, 2021) Before the tumultuous labor unrest of the 20th century, the six-day work week was the norm for most of human history. We thus see that the evolution of the work week is not a phenomenon that cannot be viewed in isolation, but rather needs to examined as a part of the long history of the struggle between labor and capital in which it is embedded."

Up until the early 20th Century, many women were not allowed to vote or participate in many professions due to limiting beliefs about their ability to participate in public life. Today, gender prejudices continue to harm both men and women. Often, women are rejected for jobs because of fears they might quit to have a baby, or a female doctor is instantly perceived to be a nurse by patients due to the workplace stereotypes ingrained in society. Many men are also often discriminated against (often by other men) if they choose to go into feminized professions like nursing and teaching. Here are the dominant gender stereotypes today: Dominant Masculinity - A man is expected to be assertive, take control, take a leadership role, and take on dangerous or physical tasks in service of women. Men who do not fit this stereotypical norm are often looked down upon by others in society as ‘beta men’. Dominant Femininity - A woman is expected to be passive, sweet, shy, and quietly spoken.

If a person appears to be from an identifiable race or ethnicity, they become categorized instantly, and they face an uphill battle trying to break through the stereotypes on people’s minds.Known throughout the world as one of the worst examples of racial discrimination that lasted into the last decade of the 20th Century, the policy enforced segregation of neighborhoods, restricted non-white people from voting, and outlawed mixed marriages.Slavery involved withdrawing the human rights of people of African descent by rendering them the property of white slave owners.This is an example of ethnic rather than racial stratification. Ethnicities are sub-groups within a society with their own unique culture and traditions. In the case of Rohingua Muslims, their culture is oriented around their religion which separates them from the Buddhist majority.Today, social stratification based on ability or disability is visible in sports, where professionals in disabled sports are underpaid and undervalued, as well as in public access to services, where people with disabilities are often unable to access (and even denied) services due to their disabilities.Typically, people within a caste are a group of people who are restricted to socializing and marrying within their caste, as well as only being able to find employment within the assigned profession of their caste.Generally, the king would grant land ownership to people based upon their loyalty and fealty to the king.

While this form of social stratification is at a historical low in our era, the monarchy in England is still run via a birthright system, while more insidiously, the dictator of North Korea is always born into their role.One of the most extreme examples of an oligarchy is that of Putin’s Russia, where he amassed power by divvying out ownership of the nation’s largest corporations to friends and people loyal to him.Professions that tend to garner more respect include lawyers, doctors, engineers, pilots, and economists.This can be both official and unofficial.In the fictional world of the Hunger Games, there is a wealthy capital city with surrounding districts that are controlled by military force by the capital.This is common, for example, in caste systems, where people must marry within their caste.As a result of these forces, rich nations have competitive advantages that allow them to get wealthier and increase the global wealth gap.",

At its most fundamental level, patriarchy is associated with the familiar unit. Weber too had based the simplest conception of his traditional authority on the ancient family and household type. The traditional form of patriarchal dominance was one where the household had a male master, who in turn handed over his inheritance to his male heir. There was no (formal) rationality in such a system other than the belief that a male heir is biologically ordained to protect and lead the family. This system of patriarchy eventually expanded outwards from the familial unit to become a hegemonic power across all of society, and eventually percolated down to the smallest units of human practice. For instance, we can see the centrality of the masculine in the use of the male pronoun “his/him/he” to refer even to a gender-neutral situation. This has become such an ingrained habit that it appears almost naturally to most people. Similarly, the conception of God as male, referring to God with male pronouns is also an almost universal subconscious social trait."

        "description": "White people can accept employment without their coworkers suspecting they got the job because of their race. By contrast, black employees in workplaces with affirmative action plans are often suspected as not being “good enough” to get the job. The assumption is they only got the job to meet quotas for people of color. This assumption ignores the fact that good affirmative action plans involve seeking out qualified professionals of color, rather than simply employing underqualified people to meet a quota. Fortunately, most available positions have many applications with the requisite skills, and therefore, the assumption that someone isn’t good enough or only got the job due to their race is generally untrue. Nevertheless, people of color continue to face suspicions from colleagues about their competency and therefore they feel they need to “earn” their place after getting the job rather than before."

        "description": "Young people who see leaders who look like them can start to see themselves as potential future leaders. They get the message that “people like me” can do that job. One question about white privilege, therefore, is: “do your representatives look like you?” You could consider your local member of parliament or even the leader of your country. Take, for example, presidents. The vast majority of presidents in United States history have been white males. Therefore, young people who are not white males can accurately assume that there is some sort of exclusionary barrier in society that holds non-white people (and women) back from reaching the upper echelons of democratic representation."

        "description": "People of color have often experienced situations where others cross to the other side of the street to get away from them. In these situations, the people avoiding them have internalized a belief in the “dangerous” person of color who shouldn’t be trusted in public spaces. Being avoided in public spaces can cause a person of color to feel as if they are a mistrusted member of society who will never be able to occupy public spaces with the confidence and impunity that their white counterparts can."

        "name": "The Knowledge Economy",
        "description": "‘Knowledge economy’ is a term used to describe economies marked by a high level of technical and scientific innovation in which employment demands high levels of technical and scientific knowledge. Such an economy stands in contrast to primary economies based on agriculture or resource extraction, and manufacturing economies that are based on skilled or unskilled manual labor. Jobs in a knowledge economy tend to be weighted towards the finance, technology, and services sector. In the present world-system, the developed countries have a predominant position in the knowledge economy, with almost all leading technology and financial sector corporations located in developed countries or the core of the world-system such as the US, Canada, the UK etc. The markets for knowledge economy products often tend to be in the peripheral or semi-peripheral countries. For instance, companies such as Facebook and WhatsApp have most of their users in countries such as India, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Bangladesh, etc. This global knowledge economy is not solely based on classification by nation-states alone, for within the peripheral and semi-peripheral countries there exist regions that are integrated within the global capitalist system. For instance, cities such as Bangalore and Mumbai in India are recognized as global hubs of Information Technology (IT) and finance, even though they are located within a semi-peripheral country. Thus, rather than there existing a simple dichotomy of core and periphery countries, the application of the world-systems theory to the knowledge economy reveals a far more complex and interconnected world-system."

        "description": "The politics of climate change are characterized by an unequal exchange. The core countries have historically extracted more of the earth’s natural resources including fossil fuels that contribute to global warming and have used more of the earth’s capacity to act as a heat sink. For example, we now know that the USA’s CO2 emissions are greater than that of all of the African continent combined, or that India has one of the lowest per capita levels of CO2 emissions in the world at 1/19th those of Canada. The world-systems theory tells us that countries or regions that form the core of the world-system have higher CO2 emissions and must consequently have a greater share in the responsibility to combat climate change as compared to countries or regions that fall in the periphery."

Hidden hunger mostly results from consumption of empty calories found in packaged food and sweetened beverages. While the global packaged food giants concentrated in the “core” countries, their products find big markets in the “periphery” countries. It has been documented that 18 of the 20 most severely affected countries by hidden hunger are in sub-Saharan Africa, while the remaining two are in the South Asian nations of India and Afghanistan (Muthayya et al.,2013)."

        "description": "1. It Explains Internal Inequalities Since the world systems theory does not take the nation-state as the primary unit of analysis, it helps explain internal inequalities within nation-states better than other development theories such as the modernization theory or the dependency theory. For instance, India, a country in the semi-periphery of the world system is home to more than 200 million people living in poverty as defined by the World Economic Forum, while at the same time having the third highest number of billionaires in the world (177), after only the US and China. Application of the world systems theory helps us understand that there are several regions within the peripheral and semi-peripheral countries that are deeply integrated with the global capitalist structure. The regional hubs within nations serve as the core to the peripheries located within the same countries. This demonstrates a much more complex and nuanced model of global inequalities than simple classifications of first world and third world countries or developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries that other models provide. Exploitation of a periphery by a core does not happen at the level of nation-states alone; a core within a country can also exploit a periphery within the same country leading to sharp regional inequalities. 2. Human-centric Rather than System-centric The world systems theory conceptualizes the entire world as one unified system rather than made of different systems and structures. In the words of Frank & Gills (1993) it allows us to see ‘a common river and unity of history in a single world system [that is] multicultural in origin and expression’. 3. Cross-domain Applicability The world systems theory can be applied to a number of fields including gender studies, ethnic and racial discrimnaiton studies, political geography, international relations to name a few. For instance, a gender studies analysis of the world system reveals the manner in which women’s labor is exploited within a capitalist system controlled by men. Nash (1988), in an analysis of the Iranian carpet making industry has shown how carpet making households led by men were located in a periphery relative to the core regions of the developed world to which these carpets were exported. Within the household however, much of the carpet-weaving work was carried out by women while the men controlled the finances, replicating the core-periphery relationship, this time within the household, and with a highly gendered aspect to it."

        "name": "Attitudinal Worldviews",
        "description": "An attitudinal worldview is a general disposition that someone has. It can be seen as the core features of a person’s personal character that tend to be consistent enough that they are seen as a person’s personality. Examples of attitudinal worldviews include optimism, pessimism, compassion, thoughtfulness, and adventurousness. The most common metaphor we use when exploring attitudinal worldviews is that of glass-half-full versus glass-half-empty. This metaphor makes us think of two people looking at the same glass of water. One person says “that glass is half full”. They are an optimist because they’re reflecting on what they have. The other person says “that glass is half empty”. They are a pessimist because they’re reflecting on what they’re missing. In performance reviews at work, an employer will often refer to a person’s attitudinal worldview. They might talk about their work ethic, optimism, or cooperativeness as things that offer value to the team. Similarly, in school report cards, teachers might reflect on a student’s friendliness, resilience, or growth mindset."

        "name": "Ideological Worldviews",
        "description": "Ideological worldviews are worldviews based upon a person’s values and ideals. They stem from a personal idea of how the world should be structured both politically and economically. Examples of ideological worldviews include capitalism, socialism, communism, social democracy, libertarianism, agrarianism, and totalitarianism. These ideological worldviews might underpin the way you vote and your perception of what rights and freedoms people should have. For example, a socialist might be more focused on social equality and ensuring people get the education and healthcare they need regardless of their income. By contrast, capitalists might be more concerned with ensuring people have the freedom to start a business and build wealth for themselves and their families. Interestingly, there is a gender slant in ideological worldviews. If we were to look at a distribution curve, we would see that women are distributed more closely toward communitarian worldviews, while men are distributed more closely toward individualistic worldviews."

Even people who do not believe in a god or are unsure can be classified as having a religious worldview (agnosticism and atheism). We can also break down religious worldviews into a few key types, including monotheism, polytheism, and atheism. Most of the world’s major religions are monotheistic, including Christianity, Islamism, Mormonism, Catholicism, and Judaism. People with a strong belief in an organized religion may turn to their founding texts (e.g. the Bible, Quran, etc.) to help shape their worldview. Through these texts, they develop beliefs around morality, how to live a good life, gender relations, and even what to eat and when to eat it!"

While philosophical worldviews are similar to, and informed by, religious and ideological worldviews, your philosophy tends to be a set of epistemological beliefs based upon critical reasoning and systematic and rational inquiry. Philosophical worldviews are also often informed by schools of thought that emerge from academic study such as pluralism, moral relativism, Marxism, postmodernism, and intellectual conservativism. For example, the philosophy of stoicism is based upon a school of thought that dates back to ancient Greece. This philosophical worldview teaches that humans should change the things they can and accept the things they cannot change. It encourages personal reflection on to build up wisdom, temperance, courage, and justice."
